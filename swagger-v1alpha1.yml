          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry

          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

    description: |-
      The serialization format is:

      <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
      (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
      <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9
      <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits>
      <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits>
      <sign>            ::= "+" | "-"
      <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number>
      <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI>
      <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
      (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
      <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
      (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
      <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>

      No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent
      a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal
      places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up.
      (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.)
      This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

      When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix
      it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

      Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
      This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a
      corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
      a. No precision is lost
      b. No fractional digits will be emitted
      c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
      The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

      Examples:
      1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
      1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

      Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a
      floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

      Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed,
      but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical
      form, or don't diff.)

      This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without
      writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will
      cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

          in this list can only be removed.
          Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
          because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
          If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
          in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
          waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
          component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
          Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
          are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

          MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
          labelSelector spread as 1/1/0:
          +-------+-------+-------+
           zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |

             P   |   P   |       |
          +-------+-------+-------+
          if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1;
          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2)
          violate MaxSkew(1).
          if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
          to topologies that satisfy it.
